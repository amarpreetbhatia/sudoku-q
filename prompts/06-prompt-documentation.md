# Creating Prompt Documentation

```
create a prompt folder and inside prompt folder, listdown all the prompts which i used to make this sudoko-q project
```

This prompt requested the creation of documentation for all the prompts used throughout the development of the Sudoku Q project. This resulted in:
- Creating a prompts directory
- Creating individual markdown files for each prompt
- Documenting the purpose and outcome of each prompt
- Organizing them in chronological order
