# Initial Project Setup Prompt

```
build a Sudoku game using react and daisyui and name of the game is "Sudoku Q", use bumbleebee as default theme to make web UI looks catchy, and also put a 3 min timer for player to finish the game. If Sudoku square finish successfully, contrats the user with button to restart the game and if unsuccessfully, say user "give a new try, you are doing great". Make this "Sudoku Q" deployable to github pages and used "react-font-awesome" where it needed to use a emoji. In the findal project, I want to use "Sudoku Q" as favicon.ico instead of default settings.
```

- "Sudoku Q" as the game name
- Bumblebee theme for the UI
