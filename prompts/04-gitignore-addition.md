# Adding .gitignore File

```
add gitignore for "node application"
```

This prompt requested the addition of a .gitignore file appropriate for a Node.js application. The created file includes patterns to ignore:
- node_modules directory
- build outputs
- environment files
- logs
- editor-specific files
- cache directories
- and other common files that shouldn't be tracked in Git
