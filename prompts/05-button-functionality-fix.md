This prompt identified an issue with the "Play Again" and "New Game" buttons not properly resetting and starting a new game. The fixes included:
- Adding a key prop to force component re-rendering
- Improving the restart logic with proper state management
- Enhancing the SudokuBoard component reset logic
- Fixing the difficulty selector's disabled state
- Adding a small timeout to ensure proper state updates
